      host_compatible: true
  # When "true" concretize root specs of environments together, so that each unique
  # package in an environment corresponds to one concrete spec. This ensures
  # environments can always be activated. When "false" perform concretization separately
  # on each root spec, allowing different versions and variants of the same package in
  # an environment.

  # Option to specify compatibility between operating systems for reuse of compilers and packages
  # Specified as a key: [list] where the key is the os that is being targeted, and the list contains the OS's
  # it can reuse. Note this is a directional compatibility so mutual compatibility between two OS's
  # requires two entries i.e. os_compatible: {sonoma: [monterey], monterey: [sonoma]}
