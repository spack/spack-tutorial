  Help on method query in module spack.database:

  query(*args, **kwargs) method of spack.database.Database instance
      Query the Spack database including all upstream databases.

      Args:
          query_spec: queries iterate through specs in the database and
              return those that satisfy the supplied ``query_spec``. If
              query_spec is `any`, This will match all specs in the
              database.  If it is a spec, we'll evaluate
              ``spec.satisfies(query_spec)``

          known (bool or any, optional): Specs that are "known" are those
              for which Spack can locate a ``package.py`` file -- i.e.,
              Spack "knows" how to install them.  Specs that are unknown may
              represent packages that existed in a previous version of
              Spack, but have since either changed their name or
              been removed

          installed (bool or any, or InstallStatus or iterable of
              InstallStatus, optional): if ``True``, includes only installed
              specs in the search; if ``False`` only missing specs, and if
              ``any``, all specs in database. If an InstallStatus or iterable
              of InstallStatus, returns specs whose install status
              (installed, deprecated, or missing) matches (one of) the
              InstallStatus. (default: True)

          explicit (bool or any, optional): A spec that was installed
              following a specific user request is marked as explicit. If
              instead it was pulled-in as a dependency of a user requested
              spec it's considered implicit.

          start_date (datetime, optional): filters the query discarding
              specs that have been installed before ``start_date``.

          end_date (datetime, optional): filters the query discarding
              specs that have been installed after ``end_date``.

          hashes (container): list or set of hashes that we can use to
              restrict the search

      Returns:
          list of specs that match the query
  (END)
