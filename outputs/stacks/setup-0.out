$ cd ~/code
$ spack env activate .
==> Error: `spack env activate` requires Spack's shell support.

  To set up shell support, run the command below for your shell.

  For bash/zsh/sh:
    . /home/spack/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh

  For csh/tcsh:
    source /home/spack/spack/share/spack/setup-env.csh

  For fish:
    source /home/spack/spack/share/spack/setup-env.fish

  Or, if you do not want to use shell support, run one of these instead:

      eval `spack env activate --sh   [...]`    bash/zsh/sh
      eval `spack env activate --csh  [...]`    csh/tcsh
      eval `spack env activate --fish [...]`    fish

  If you have already set up Spack's shell support but still receive
  this message, please make sure to call Spack via the `spack` command
  without any path components (such as `bin/spack`).

$ spack config edit
