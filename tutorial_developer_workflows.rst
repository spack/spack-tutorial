Developer Workflows Tutorial
============================

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using the ``spack
develop`` command to develop software from local source code within a
spack environment. With this command spack will manage your
dependencies while you focus on testing changes to your library and/or
application.


-----------------------------
Installing from local source
-----------------------------

The ``spack install`` command, as you know, fetches source code from a
mirror or the internet before building and installing your package. As
developers, we want to build from local source, which we will
constantly change, build, and test.

Let's imagine for a second we're working on ``scr``.  ``scr`` is a
library used to implement scalable checkpointing in application
codes. It supports writing/reading checkpoints quickly and efficiently
using MPI and high-bandwidth file I/O. We'd like to test changes to
scr within an actual application so we'll test with ``macsio``, a
proxy application written to mimic typical HPC I/O workloads. We've
chosen ``scr`` and ``macsio`` because together they are quick to
build.

We'll start by making an environment for our development.  We need to
build ``macsio`` with ``scr`` support, and we'd like everything to be
built without fortran support for the time being. Let's set up that
development workflow.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/dev/setup-scr.out
   :language: console

Before we do any work, we verify that this all builds.  Spack ends up
building the entire development tree below, and links everything
together for you.

    }

Now we are ready to begin work on the actual application.

-----------------------------
Development iteration cycles
-----------------------------

Let's assume that scr has a bug, and we'd like to patch scr to find
out what the problem is.  First, we tell spack that we'd like to check
out the version of scr that we want to work on. In this case, it will
be the 3.1.0 release that we want to write a patch for:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/dev/develop-1.out
   :language: console

The spack develop command marks the package as being a "development"
package in the spack.yaml. This adds a special ``dev_path=`` attribute
to the spec for the package, so spack remembers where the source code
for this package is located. The develop command also downloads/checks
out the source code for the package. By default, the source code is
downloaded into a subdirectory of the environment. You can change the
location of this source directory by modifying the ``path:`` attribute
of the develop configuration in the environment.

There are a few gotchas with the spack develop command

* You often specify the package version manually when specifying a
  package as a dev package. Spack needs to know the version of the dev
  package so it can supply the correct flags for the package's build
  system. If a version is not supplied then spack will take the maximum version
  defined in the package where where `infinity versions <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#version-comparison>`_ like ``develop`` and ``main``
  have a higher value than the numeric versions.
* You should ensure a spec for the package you are developing appears in the DAG of at least one of the roots of the environment with the same version that you are developing.
  ``spack add <package>`` with the matching version you want to develop is a way to ensure
  the develop spec is satisfied.the ``spack.yaml`` environments file. This is because 
  develop specs are not concretization constraints but rather a criteria for adding
  the ``dev_path=`` variant to existing spec.
* You'll need to re-concretize the environment so that the version
  number and the ``dev_path=`` attributes are properly added to the
  cached spec in ``spack.lock``.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/dev/develop-conc.out
   :language: console

Now that we have this done, we tell spack to rebuild both ``scr`` and
``macsio`` by running ``spack install``.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/dev/develop-2.out
   :language: console

This rebuilds ``scr`` from the subdirectory we specified. If your
package uses cmake, spack will build the package in a build directory
that matches the hash for your package. From here you can change into
the appropriate directory and perform your own build/test cycles.

Now, we can develop our code. For the sake of this demo, we're just
going to intentionally introduce an error. Let's edit a file and
remove the first semi-colon we find.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/dev/edit-1.out
   :language: console

Once you have a development package, ``spack install`` also works much
like "make". Since spack knows the source code directory of the
package, it checks the filetimes on the source directory to see if
we've made recent changes.  If the file times are newer, it will
rebuild ``scr`` and any other package that depends on ``scr``.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/dev/develop-3.out
   :language: console

Here, the build failed as expected. We can look at the output for the
build in ``scr/spack-build-out.txt`` to find out why, or we can
launch a shell directly with the appropriate environment variables to
figure out what went wrong by using ``spack build-env scr@2.0 --
bash``.  If that's too much to remember, then sourcing
``scr/spack-build-env.txt`` will also set all the appropriate
environment variables so we can diagnose the build ourselves. Now
let's fix it and rebuild directly.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/dev/develop-4.out
   :language: console

You'll notice here that spack rebuilt both ``scr`` and ``macsio``, as
expected.

Taking advantage of iterative builds with spack requires cooperation
from your build system.  When spack performs a rebuild on a
development package, it reruns all the build stages for your package
without cleaning the source and build directories to a pristine
state. If your build system can take advantage of the previously
compiled object files then you'll end up with an iterative build.

- If your package just uses make, you also should get iterative builds
  for free when running ``spack develop``.
- If your package uses cmake with the typical ``cmake`` / ``build`` /
  ``install`` build stages, you'll get iterative builds for free with
  spack because cmake doesn’t modify the filetime on the
  ``CMakeCache.txt`` file if your cmake flags haven't changed.
- If your package uses autoconf, then rerunning the typical
  ``autoreconf`` stage typically modifies the filetime of
  ``config.h``, which can trigger a cascade of rebuilding.

Multiple packages can also be marked as develop. If we were
co-developing ``macsio``, we could run

.. literalinclude:: outputs/dev/develop-5.out
   :language: console

Using development workflows also lets us ship our whole development
process to another developer on the team.  They can simply take our
spack.yaml, create a new environment, and use this to replicate our
build process. For example, we'll make another development environment
here.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/dev/otherdevel.out
   :language: console

Here, ``spack develop`` with no arguments will check out or download
the source code and place it in the appropriate places.

When we're done developing, we simply tell spack that it no longer
needs to keep a development version of the package.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/dev/wrapup.out
   :language: console

-------------------
Workflow Summary
-------------------

Use the ``spack develop`` command with an environment to make a
reproducible build environment for your development workflow. Spack
will set up all the dependencies for you and link all your packages
together. Within a development environment, ``spack install`` works
similar to ``make`` in that it will check file times to rebuild the
minimum number of spack packages necessary to reflect the changes to
your build.

-------------------
Optional: Tips and Tricks
-------------------

This section will cover some additional features that are useful additions
to the core tutorial above. Many of these items are very useful to specific
projects and developers. A list of the options for the ``spack develop`` can
be viewed below:

.. code-block:: console

   $ spack develop --help

Source Code Management
----------

``spack develop`` allows users to manipulate the source code locations
The default behavior is to let spack manage its location and cloning operations,
but software developers often want more control over these.

The source directory can be set with the ``--path`` argument when calling ``spack develop``.
If this directory already exists then ``spack develop`` will not attempt to fetch the code 
for you. This allows developers to pre-clone the software or use preferred paths as they wish.

.. code-block:: console

   # pre-clone the source code and then point spack develop to it
   # note that we can clone into any repo/branch combination desired
   $ git clone https://github.com/llnl/scr.git $SPACK_ENV/code
   # note that with `--path` the code directory and package name can be different
   $ spack develop --path $SPACK_ENV/code scr@3.1.0
   $ spack concretize -f

Navigation and the Build Environment
----------

Diving into the build environment was introduced previously in the packaging section with the
``spack build-env scr -- bash`` command. This is a helpful function because it allows you 
to run commands inside the build environment.  In the packages section of the tutorial
this was combined with ``spack cd`` to produce a manual build outside of Spack's automated
Process.
This command is particularly useful in developer environments -- it allows developers a streamlined
workflow when iterating on a single package without the overhead of the ``spack install`` command.
The additional features of the install command are unnecessary when tightly iterating between building
 and testing a particular package. For example, the workflow modifying ``scr`` that we just went through
 can be simplified to:

 .. code-block:: console

    $ spack build-env scr -- bash
    # Shell wrappers didn't propagate to the subshell
    $ source $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/setup-env.sh
    # Lets look at navigation features
    $ spack cd --help
    $ spack cd -c scr
    $ touch src/scr_copy.c
    $ spack cd -b scr
    # Lets look at whats here
    $ ls
    # Build and run tests
    $ make -j2
    $ make test
    $ exit

Working with the build environment and along with spack navigation features
provides a nice way to iterate quickly and navigate through the hash heavy
spack directory structures.

Combinatorics
------------

The final note we will look at in this tutorial will be the power of combinatoric
development builds.  There are many instances where developers want to see how
a single set of changes affects multiple builds i.e. ``+cuda`` vs ``~cuda``,
``%gcc`` vs ``%clang``, ``build_type=Release`` vs ``build_type=Debug``, etc.

Developers can achieve builds of both cases from a single ``spack install`` as 
long as the develop spec is generic enough to cover the packages' spec variations

.. code-block:: console

   # First we have to allow repeat specs in the environment
   $ spack config add concretizer:unify:false
   # Next we need to specify the specs we want ('==' propagates the variant to deps)
   $ spack change macsio build_type==Release
   $ spack add macsio+scr build_type==Debug
   # Inspect the graph for multiple dev_path=
   $ spack concretize -f

While we won't build out this example it illustrates how the ``dev_path`` for
``build_type=Release`` and ``build_type=Debug`` points to the same source code.

Now if we want to do most of our incremental builds using the ``Release`` build
and periodically check the results using the ``Debug`` build we can combine the
workflow from the previous example: dive into the ``Release`` versions build
environment using ``spack build-env scr build_type=Release -- bash`` and 
navigate with ``spack cd -b scr build_type=Release``. Note that since there
are two ``scr`` specs in the environment we must distinguish which one we
want for these commands. When we are ready to check our changes for  the debug
build we can exit out of the build environment subshell,
rerun ``spack install`` to rebuild everything, and then inspect the debug build
through our method of choice.
