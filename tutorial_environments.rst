Environments Tutorial
=====================

We've covered how to install, remove, and list packages with Spack using the
commands:

* `spack install <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#cmd-spack-install>`_ to install packages;
* `spack uninstall <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#cmd-spack-uninstall>`_ to remove them; and
* `spack find <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#cmd-spack-find>`_ to look at and query what is installed.

.. Customizing Spack's installation with configuration files, like
   `packages.yaml <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#build-settings>`_, was also discussed.

This section of the tutorial introduces **Spack Environments**, which
allow you to work with independent groups of packages separately. The
goal is to provide users with *virtual environments* similar to those
supported by other commonly used tools (e.g., `Python venv
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_) while allowing
common installations to be seamlessly shared. They are also intended
to be easily shared and re-used by others and across systems.

Administering properly configured software involving lots of packages
and/or varying configuration requirements (e.g., different implementations
of ``mpi``) for multiple projects and efforts can be overwhelming. Spack
environments allow you to readily:

* establish standard software requirements for your project(s);
* set up run environments for users;
* support your usual development environment(s);
* set up packages for CI/CD;
* reproduce builds (approximately or exactly) on other machines; and
* much more.

This tutorial introduces the basics of creating and using environments,
then explains how to expand, configure, and build software in them.
We will start with the command line interface, then cover editing key
environment file directly. We will describe the difference between
Spack-managed and independent environments, then finish with a section
on reproducible builds.

-------------------
Environment Basics
-------------------

Let's look at the output of ``spack find`` at this point in the tutorial.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/find-no-env-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


This is a complete, but cluttered list of the installed packages and
their dependencies. It contains packages built with both ``openmpi``
and ``mpich``, as well as multiple variants of other packages, like
``hdf5`` and ``zlib``. The query mechanism we learned about with
``spack find`` can help, but it would be nice if we could start from
a clean slate without losing what we've already installed.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Creating and activating environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``spack env`` command can help. Let's create a new environment
called ``myproject``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-create-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


An environment is like a virtualized Spack instance that you can
use to aggregate package installations for a project or other purpose.
It has an associated *view*, which is a single prefix where all packages
from the environment are linked.

You can see the environments we've created so far using the ``spack env
list`` command:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-list-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


Now let's **activate** our environment. You can use ``spack env activate``
command:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-activate-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


You can also use the ``spacktivate`` alias for short.

.. note::
   If you use the ``-p`` option for ``spack env activate``, Spack
   will prepend the environment name to the prompt. This is a handy
   way to be reminded if and which environment you are in.


Once you activate an environment, ``spack find`` only shows what is
in the current environment. We just created this environment, so it
does not contain any installed packages.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/find-env-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

The output from ``spack find`` is now *slightly* different. It tells
you that you're in the ``myproject`` environment, so there is no need
to panic when you see that none of the previously installed packages
are available. It also states that there are **no** *root specs*. We'll
get back to what that means later.

If you *only* want to check what environment you are in, you can use
``spack env status``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-status-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


If you want to leave this environment, you can use ``spack env deactivate``
or the ``despacktivate`` alias for short.

After deactivating, we can see everything installed in this Spack instance:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-status-2.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,2,4


Notice that we are no longer in an environment and all our packages
are still installed.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Installing packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that we understand how creation and activation work, let's go
back to ``myproject`` and *install* a couple of packages; specifically,
``tcl`` and ``trilinos``.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-install-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,2,5,71

We see that ``tcl`` and all of the dependencies of ``trilinos`` are
already installed. Notice also that our environment's view gets updated.

Now confirm the contents of the environment using ``spack find``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/find-env-2.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


We now see that ``tcl`` and ``trilinos`` are **root specs** in
our environment. That is because we explicitly asked for them to
be installed, which makes them the **roots** of the combined graph
of all packages in the environment. The other installed packages
are present because they are dependencies of one or both of the roots.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Environments provide a convenient way for using installed packages.
Running ``spack env activate`` gives you everything in the environment
on your ``PATH``. Otherwise, you would need to use `spack load
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#cmd-spack-load>`_
or `module load
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/module_file_support.html>`_
for each package in order to set up the environment for the package (and
its dependencies).

When you install packages into an environment, they are, by default,
linked into a single prefix, or *view*. Activating the environment
with ``spack env activate`` results in subdirectories from the view
being added to ``PATH``, ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``,
and other environment variables. This makes the environment easier to use.

Let's try it out. We just installed ``tcl`` into our ``myproject``
environment. ``Tcl`` includes a shell-like application called ``tclsh``.
You can see the path to ``tclsh`` using ``which``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/use-tcl-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


Notice its path includes the name of our environment *and* a ``view``
subdirectory.

You can now run ``tclsh`` like you would any other program that is
in your path:

.. code-block:: console

	$ tclsh
	% echo "hello world!"
	hello world!
	% exit

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Uninstalling packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can uninstall packages from an environment without affecting
other environments. This is possible since, while Spack shares
common installations, environments only link to those installations.

Let's demonstrate this feature by creating another environment.
Suppose ``myproject`` requires ``trilinos`` but we have another
project that has it installed but no longer requires it.

Start by creating a ``myproject2`` environment with the installed
packages ``hdf5+hl`` and ``trilinos``. To ensure we're leveraging
the tutorial build cache, let's explicitly constrain ``hdf5``'s
``mpi`` dependency to ``mpich``.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-create-2.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,5-6,9,12


Notice the root specs show the specs and variants as we asked for
them on the command line. In this case, ``hdf5`` shows we enabled the
``hl`` variant.

Now we have two environments. The ``myproject`` environment has ``tcl``
and ``trilinos`` while the ``myproject2`` environment has ``hdf5 +hl``
and ``trilinos``.

Now let's uninstall ``trilinos`` from ``myproject2`` and review the
contents of the environment:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-uninstall-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,11


The result is that the environment now has only one root spec, ``hdf5
+hl``, and contains fewer dependencies.

However, we know ``trilinos`` is still needed for the ``myproject``
environment. So let's switch back to confirm that it is still installed
in that environment.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-swap-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2


Phew! We see that ``myproject`` still has ``trilinos`` as a root
spec. Spack uses reference counting to know that ``trilinos`` is
still installed for ``myproject``.

.. note::

   Trilinos would only have been uninstalled by Spack if it were
   no longer needed by any environments or their package dependencies.


-------------------------------
Dealing with Many Specs at Once
-------------------------------

So far we have used ``install`` and ``uninstall`` for processing
individual packages. Since environments define sets of packages,
their specs *can* be added to the environment before they are
installed together. Specs can be added at the command line or
entered directly in the environment configuration file.

Whole environments can be installed at once by adding specs to
the environment before installing them. Individual packages can
still be added and removed from the environment as it evolves.

There are a couple of advantages of processing all the specs
of an environment at once. First, we don't have to write a custom
installation script outside of Spack. Second, we can launch a
large build of many packages in parallel by taking advantage of
Spack's `install-level build parallelism
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#install-level-build-parallelism>`_.

This section focuses on two ways to add specs to the environment before
installing them.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Adding specs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let's start by *adding* a couple of specs to our ``myproject``
environment:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/add-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2,4

Now let's take a look at what happened using ``spack find``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/find-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

Notice the two specs we added, ``hdf5 +hl`` and ``gmp``, are now
listed as **root specs**. They are not actually installed in the
environment yet because ``spack add`` only adds *roots* to the
environment.

*All* of the yet-to-be-installed packages can be installed in an
active environment by simply running ``spack install`` with no
arguments:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/add-2.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,40,80


Spack concretizes the new root specs before ensuring that all
the associated packages are installed. You can confirm this using
``spack find``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/add-3.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Configuring specs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An environment is more than just a list of root specs. It includes
*configuration* settings that affect the way Spack behaves when the
environment is activated. So far, ``myproject`` relies on configuration
defaults that can be overridden. Here we'll look at how to add specs
and ensure all the packages depending on ``mpi`` build with ``mpich``.

Running ``spack spec`` shows that concretization looks the same as it
does outside the environment:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/spec-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

We can customize the selection of the ``mpi`` provider using
`concretization preferences
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#concretization-preferences>`_
to change the behavior of the concretizer.

Let's start by looking at the configuration of our environment using
``spack config get``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/config-get-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

The output shows the special YAML configuration format that Spack
uses to store the environment configuration. Currently, the file
is just a ``spack:`` header and a list of the **root** ``specs``.

.. note::

   Before proceeding, make sure your ``EDITOR`` environment variable
   is set to the path of your preferred text editor.

Let's edit this file to *prefer* ``mpich`` as our ``mpi`` provider
using ``spack config edit``.

You should now have the above file open in your editor. Change it
to include the ``packages:all:providers:mpi:`` entry below:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # This is a Spack Environment file.
   #
   # It describes a set of packages to be installed, along with
   # configuration settings.
   spack:
     packages:
       all:
         providers:
           mpi: [mpich]

     # add package specs to the `specs` list
     specs: [tcl, trilinos, hdf5+hl ^mpich, gmp]


.. note::

   This setting only defines the **default** ``mpi`` provider.
   You can still override the provider on the command line, e.g.,
   with ``spack install hdf5 ^openmpi``.

   We introduce this here to show you how environment configuration
   can affect concretization. Configuration options are covered in much
   more detail in the :ref:`configuration tutorial <configs-tutorial>`.


Let's see the effects of this change on our package using ``spack spec``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/spec-2.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

Notice ``mpich`` is now the ``mpi`` dependency for our concretized
spec. We also see all of its concrete dependencies.

We've only scratched the surface here by changing the default of
the ``mpi`` provider for packages depending on ``mpi``. There
are many other customizations you can make to an environment.
Refer to the links at the end of this section for more information.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Re-concretizing the environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may need to re-install packages in the environment after making
significant changes to the configuration, such as changing virtual
providers. This can be accomplished by forcing Spack to re-concretize
the environment and re-install the specs.

For example, the packages installed in our ``myproject`` environment
are now out of sync with our new configuration since we already
installed part of the environment with ``openmpi``. Suppose we want
to install everything in ``myproject`` with ``mpich``.

Let's run ``spack concretize --force`` to make Spack re-concretize
all the environment's specs:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/concretize-f-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


All the specs are now concrete **and** ready to be installed with
``mpich`` as the MPI implementation. You can now re-run ``spack
install`` to finish the process.

.. code-block:: console

   $ spack install

------------------------
Building in environments
------------------------

Activated environments allow you to invoke any programs installed
in them as if they were installed on the system. In this section
we will take advantage of that feature.

Suppose you want to compile some MPI programs. We have an MPI
implementation installed in our ``myproject`` environment, so
``mpicc`` is available in our path. We can confirm this using
``which``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/show-mpicc-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,3


As mentioned before, activating the environment sets a number of
environment variables. That includes variables like ``PATH``,
``LIBRARY_PATH``, and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, which allows you to
easily find package executables and libraries installed in the environment.

Let's look specifically at path-related environment variables using
``env | grep PATH``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/show-paths-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


We can demonstrate use of these environment settings by building a
really simple MPI program.

Let's create a program called ``mpi-hello.c`` that contains the following
code:

.. code-block:: c

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <mpi.h>
	#include <zlib.h>

	int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	  int rank;
	  MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

	  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
	  printf("Hello world from rank %d\n", rank);

	  if (rank == 0) {
	    printf("zlib version: %s\n", ZLIB_VERSION);
	  }

	  MPI_Finalize();
	}

This program includes headers from ``mpi`` and ``zlib``.
It also prints out a message from each MPI rank and the
version of ``zlib``.

Let's build and run our program:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/use-mpi-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2


Notice that we only needed to pass the include path to the
compiler.
We also see that ``Hello world`` is output for each of the ranks
and the version of ``zlib`` used to build the program is printed.

We can confirm the version of ``zlib`` used to build the program
is in our environment using ``spack find``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/myproject-zlib-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

Note that the reported version *does* match that of our installation.

------------------
Reproducing builds
------------------

Spack environments provide users with *virtual environments*
similar to `Python venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_
and `Conda environments
<https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#>`_). The goal is to ensure packages in one environment
are kept separate from those of another. These environments can
be managed by Spack or independent. In either case, their environment
files can be used to reproduce builds by other users and on other machines.
Since those files are key to reproducing builds, let's start with them.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Environment files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two key files tracking the contents of environments:
``spack.yaml`` and ``spack.lock``. The ``spack.yaml`` file holds
the environment configuration that we previously edited through
``spack config edit``. The ``spack.lock`` file is automatically
generated during concretization.

The two files represent two fundamental concepts:

* ``spack.yaml``: *abstract* specs and configuration to install; and
* ``spack.lock``: all fully *concrete* specs.


These files are intended to be used by developers and administrators
to manage the environments in a reproducible way. We will cover their
re-use later.

.. note::

   Both environment files can be versioned in repositories, shared, and
   used to install the same set of software by different users and on
   other machines.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Managed versus independent environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Environments are either Spack-managed or independent. Both types
of environments are defined by their environment files. So far
we have only created managed environments. This section describes
their differences.

*Managed environments* are created using ``spack env create <name>``.
They are automatically created in the ``var/spack/environments``
subdirectory and can be referenced by their names.

*Independent environments* can be created in one of two ways. First,
the Spack environment file(s) can be placed in any directory
(other than ``var/spack/environments``). Alternatively, you can
use ``spack env create -d <directory>`` to specify the directory
(``<directory>``) in which the files should reside. Independent
environments are not named.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reviewing a managed environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We created our currently active environment, ``myproject``, earlier
using ``spack env create myproject`` so let's mainly focus on its
environment files in this section.

Earlier, when we changed our environment's configuration using ``spack
config edit``, we were actually editing its ``spack.yaml`` file. We
can change to the directory containing the file using ``spack cd``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/filenames-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2,4


Notice that ``myproject`` is a subdirectory of ``var/spack/environments``
within the Spack installation making it a *managed* environment.
Consequently, it can be referenced by name. It will also show up
when running ``spack env list``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-list-2.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


You can see that ``myproject`` is active because it is highlighted
in green.

We can also see from the listing that the environment directory
contains both of the environment files: ``spack.yaml`` and ``spack.lock``.
This is because ``spack.lock`` was generated when we concretized
the environment.

If we ``cat`` the ``spack.yaml`` file, we'll see the same specs and view
options previously shown by ``spack config get``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/cat-config-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Creating an independent environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Environments do not have to be created in or managed by a Spack
instance. Rather, their environment files can be placed in any
directory. This feature can be quite helpful for use cases such
as environment-based software releases and CI/CD.

Let's create an *independent* environment from scratch for a simple
project:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/anonymous-create-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1-4


Notice that the command shows Spack created the environment, updated
the view, and printed the command needed to activate it. As we
can see in the activation command, since the environment is independent,
it must be referenced by its directory path.

Let's see what really happened with this command by listing the
directory contents and looking at the configuration file:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/anonymous-create-2.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,3


Notice that Spack created a ``spack.yaml`` file in the *code* directory.
Also note that the configuration file has an empty spec list (i.e.,
``[]``). That list is intended to contain only the *root specs* of
the environment.

We can confirm that it is not a managed environment by running
``spack env list``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-list-2.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

and noting that the path does not appear in the output.

Now let's add some specs to the environment. Suppose your project
depends on ``trilinos`` and ``openmpi``. Add these
packages to the spec list using your favorite text editor. The
dash syntax for a YAML list is used in our example. Your package
should now contain the following entries:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # This is a Spack Environment file.
   #
   # It describes a set of packages to be installed, along with
   # configuration settings.
   spack:
     # add package specs to the `specs` list
     specs:
     - trilinos
     - openmpi
     view: true

Now activate the environment and install the packages:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/install-anonymous-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2,66-68


Notice that Spack concretized the specs before installing them and
their dependencies. It also updated the environment's view. Since
we already installed all these packages outside of the environment,
their links were simply added to it.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Updating an installed environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Spack supports tweaking an environment even after the initial specs
are installed. You are free to add and remove specs just as you would
outside of the environment using the command line interface as before.

For example, let's add ``hdf5`` and look at our file:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/add-anonymous-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,3


Notice that ``spack add`` added the package to our active environment and
it appears in the configuration file's spec list.

.. note::

   You'll need to run ``spack install`` to install added packages
   in your environment because ``spack add`` only adds it to the
   configuration.

Now use ``spack remove`` to remove the spec from the configuration:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/remove-anonymous-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,3

and we see that the spec *was* removed from the spec list of our
environment.

.. note::

   You can also edit the ``spack.yaml`` file directly instead of
   using the ``spack add`` and ``spack remove`` commands.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reviewing ``spack.lock``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's turn our attention from the abstract to the concrete.

Our focus so far has been on the abstract environment configuration
represented by the ``spack.yaml`` file. Once that file is concretized,
Spack *generates* a corresponding ``spack.lock`` file representing
the full concretized state of the environment.

This file is intended to be a machine-readable representation of the
information needed to *reproduce* the build of an environment. As such,
it is written in ``json``, which is less readable than ``yaml``.

Let's look at the top 30 lines of our current environment:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/lockfile-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


While it is still readable, it consists of over 1300 lines of
information representing the actual configurations for each of
the environment's packages.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Reproducing an environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that we've described the contents of the environment files we can
discuss how they can be used to reproduce environments. You may want
to do this yourself on a different machine, or use an environment
built by someone else. The process is the same in either case.

You can recreate an environment by passing either of the environment
files to ``spack env create``. The file you choose depends on whether
you want to approximate the build using the abstract specs or an *exact*
build based on the concrete specs.

""""""""""""""""""""
Using ``spack.yaml``
""""""""""""""""""""

An approximate build is created using the ``spack.yaml`` file. This
approach is relevant when we want to build the same specs on a new
platform, for example. It allows you to reproduce the environment
by preserving the abstract requirements in the file. However, the
software may actually build differently in part because the concretizer
may choose different dependencies.

Let's use ``spack env create`` to create an abstract environment from
the file that we'll call ``abstract``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/create-from-file-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1


Here we see that Spack created a managed environment with the name
we provided.

And, since it is a newly created environment, it does not have any
*installed* specs yet as we can see from calling ``spack find``
**after** activating the environment:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/find-env-abstract-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2

Notice that we have the same root specs as were listed in the ``spack.yaml``
file.

""""""""""""""""""""
Using ``spack.lock``
""""""""""""""""""""

The ``spack.lock`` file is used for an exact reproduction of the
original build. It can replicate the build because it contains the
information for all the decisions made during concretization.

Now let's create a concrete environment, called ``concrete``, from
the file:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/create-from-file-2.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2

Here we see that Spack again created a managed environment with the
provided name.

Since we created the environment from our ``spack.lock`` file,
not only do we get the same root specs, all of the packages are
installed in the environment as we can see from calling
``spack find`` **after** activating the environment:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/find-env-concrete-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2

.. note::

   Use of ``spack.lock`` to reproduce a build (currently) requires you
   to be on the same type of machine.
