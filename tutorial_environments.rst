Environments Tutorial
=====================

So far, we've shown you the basics of how to install and remove packages with
Spack. You can use `spack install
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#cmd-spack-install>`_
to install packages, `spack uninstall
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#cmd-spack-uninstall>`_
to remove them, and `spack find
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#cmd-spack-find>`_ to
look at and query what is installed.

If you build a lot of software, or if you work on multiple projects,
managing everything in one place can be overwhelming. The default ``spack
find`` output may contain many packages, but you may want to *just* focus
on packages for a particular project.  Moreover, you may want to include
special configuration with your package groups, e.g., to build all the
packages in the same group the same way. Or, you may want to build up
development workflows around a subset of packages.

Spack **environments** provide a way to handle these problems.

-------------------
Environment Basics
-------------------

Let's look at the output of ``spack find`` at this point in the tutorial.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/find-no-env-1.out
   :language: console


This is a complete, but cluttered view.  There are packages built with
both ``openmpi`` and ``mpich``, as well as multiple variants of other
packages, like ``zlib``.  The query mechanism we learned about in ``spack
find`` can help, but it would be nice if we could start from a clean
slate without losing what we've already done.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Creating and activating environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``spack env`` command can help.  Let's create a new environment:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-create-1.out
   :language: console


An environment is a virtualized ``spack`` instance that you can use for a
specific purpose.  The environment also has an associated *view*, which
is a single prefix where all packages from the environment are linked.

You can see the environments we've created so far like this:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-list-1.out
   :language: console


And you can **activate** an environment with ``spack env activate``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-activate-1.out
   :language: console


Once you enter an environment, ``spack find`` shows only what is in the
current environment.  We just created this environment, so we have a
clean slate -- 0 packages:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/find-env-1.out
   :language: console

The ``spack find`` output is still *slightly* different.  It tells you
that you're in the ``myproject`` environment, so that you don't panic
when you see that there is nothing installed.  It also says that there
are *no root specs*.  We'll get back to what that means later.

If you *only* want to check what environment you are in, you can use
``spack env status``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-status-1.out
   :language: console


If you want to leave this environment and go back to normal Spack,
you can use ``spack env deactivate``.  We like to use the
``despacktivate`` alias (which Spack sets up automatically) for short:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-status-2.out
   :language: console


Phew -- all of our packages are still installed.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Installing packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ok, now that we understand how creation and activation work, let's go
back to ``myproject`` and *install* a few packages:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-install-1.out
   :language: console


We've installed ``tcl`` and ``trilinos`` in our environment, along with
all of their dependencies.  We call ``tcl`` and ``trilinos`` the
**roots** because we asked for them explicitly.  The other 20 packages
listed under "installed packages" are present because they were needed as
dependencies.  So, these are the roots of the packages' dependency graph.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you install packages into an environment, they are linked into a
single prefix, or a *view*.  When you *activate* the environment with
``spack env activate``, Spack adds subdirectories from the view to
``PATH``, ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` and other
environment variables.  This makes the environment easier to use.

Without environments, you need to ``spack load`` or ``module load`` a
package in order to use it.  With environments, you can simply run
``spack env activate`` to get everything in the environment on your
``PATH``.

Let's try it out.  ``myproject`` is still the active environment, and we
just installed ``tcl``.  You can see ``tclsh`` in your ``PATH``
immediately:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/use-tcl-1.out
   :language: console


And you can run it like you would any other program:

.. code-block:: console

	$ tclsh
	% echo "hello world!"
	hello world!
	% exit

Likewise, we installed Trilinos, and you can run some of its sub-programs
as well:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/use-trilinos-1.out
   :language: console


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Uninstalling packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's create *another* project.  We'll call this one ``myproject2``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-create-2.out
   :language: console


Now we have two environments: one with ``tcl`` and ``trilinos``, and
another with ``hdf5 +hl`` and ``trilinos``.  Notice that the roots display *exactly* as
we asked for them on the command line -- the ``hdf5`` for this environemnt has an
``+hl`` requirement.

We can uninstall trilinos from ``myproject2`` as you would expect:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-uninstall-1.out
   :language: console


Now there is only one root spec, ``hdf5 +hl``, which requires fewer
additional dependencies.

However, we still needed ``trilinos`` for the ``myproject`` environment!
What happened to it?  Let's switch back and see.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/env-swap-1.out
   :language: console


Spack is smart enough to realize that ``trilinos`` is still present in
the other environment.  Trilinos won't *actually* be uninstalled unless
it is no longer needed by any environments or packages.  If it is still
needed, it is only removed from the environment.

-------------------------------
Dealing with Many Specs at Once
-------------------------------

In the above examples, we just used ``install`` and ``uninstall``.  There
are other ways to deal with groups of packages, as well.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Adding specs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While we're still in ``myproject``, let's *add* a few specs instead of installing them:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/add-1.out
   :language: console

Let's take a close look at what happened.  The two requirements we added,
``hdf5 +hl`` and ``gmp``, are present, but they're not installed in the
environment yet.  ``spack add`` just adds *roots* to the environment, but
it does not automatically install them.

We can install *all* the as-yet uninstalled packages in an environment by
simply running ``spack install`` with no arguments:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/add-2.out
   :language: console


Spack will concretize the new roots, and install everything you added to
the environment.  Now we can see the installed roots in the output of
``spack find``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/add-3.out
   :language: console


We can build whole environments this way, by adding specs and installing
all at once, or we can install them with the usual ``install`` and
``uninstall`` portions.  The advantage to doing them all at once is that
we don't have to write a script outside of Spack to automate this, and we
can kick off a large build of many packages easily.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An environment is more than just a list of root specs. It can also include
*configuration* that changes the way Spack behaves when the environment is
activated. So far, ``myproject`` does not have any special configuration
associated with it. If you run ``spack spec``, you can see that concretization
looks the same as it does outside the environment:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/spec-1.out
   :language: console

We can customize this using `concretization preferences
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#concretization-preferences>`_
-- special configuration that changes the behavior of the concretizer.

Let's start by looking at the configuration of your environment. You can see
how your environment is configured using ``spack config get``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/config-get-1.out
   :language: console

The output shows the special YAML configuration format that Spack uses to store
the state of your environment. Currently, the file is just a ``spack:`` header
and a list of ``specs``. These are the roots.

You can edit this file to add your own custom configuration.  Spack
provides a shortcut to do that:

.. code-block:: console

   spack config edit

You should now see the same file in your editor. Change it to look like this:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # This is a Spack Environment file.
   #
   # It describes a set of packages to be installed, along with
   # configuration settings.
   spack:
     packages:
       all:
         providers:
           mpi: [mpich]

     # add package specs to the `specs` list
     specs: [tcl, trilinos, hdf5, gmp]


We will learn much more in the :ref:`configuration section <configs-tutorial>`,
but for now, all you need to know is that this changes the default ``mpi``
provider. That is, if a package depends on ``mpi``, Spack will now satisfy that
dependency with ``mpich`` instead of the default ``openmpi``.

To see what this looks like, run ``spack spec`` again in the environment. You
can see that the spec concretizes with ``mpich`` as the MPI implementation:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/spec-2.out
   :language: console


In addition to the ``packages`` section, an environment can contain many other
types of configuration. You can add custom package repositories, a custom
install location, custom compilers, custom external packages, and more. There
are also ways to build workflows for CI and for software development using
environment configuration, which we'll learn later in the tutorial.

Right now, though, we have a problem. We already installed part of this
environment with openmpi, but now we want to install everything with ``mpich``.

You can run ``spack concretize --force`` inside of an environment to concretize
all of its specs. We can run it here:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/concretize-f-1.out
   :language: console


Now, all the specs in the environment are concrete and ready to be
installed with ``mpich`` as the MPI implementation.

Normally, we could just run ``spack config edit``, edit the environment
configuration, ``spack add`` some specs, and ``spack install``.

But, when we already have installed packages in the environment, we have
to force everything in the environment to be re-concretized using ``spack
concretize --force``.  *Then* we can re-run ``spack install``.


---------------------------------
Building in environments
---------------------------------

You can use environments to set up a development environment. With the
environment activated, you can invoke any programs installed in the
environment. Suppose you wanted to compile some MPI programs. This environment
happens to have ``mpicc`` installed:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/show-mpicc-1.out
   :language: console


In addition, activating the environment has set variables like ``CPATH``,
``LIBRARY_PATH``, and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``, so that you can easily find headers
and libraries from programs in the environemnt.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/show-paths-1.out
   :language: console


Let's use this to build a really simple MPI program. Make a simple test program
like this one. Call it ``mpi-hello.c``.

.. code-block:: c

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <mpi.h>
	#include <zlib.h>

	int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	  int rank;
	  MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);

	  MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
	  printf("Hello world from rank %d\n", rank);

	  if (rank == 0) {
	    printf("zlib version: %s\n", ZLIB_VERSION);
	  }

	  MPI_Finalize();
	}

This program includes a header from zlib, and prints out a message from each
MPI rank. It also prints the zlib version.

All you need to do is build and run it:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/use-mpi-1.out
   :language: console


Note that we did not need to pass any special arguments to the compiler; just
the source file. This simple example only scratches the surface, but you can
use environments to set up dependencies for a project, set up a run environment
for a user, support your usual development environment, and many other use
cases. We'll revisit some advanced use cases later, in the :ref:`developer
workflows <developer-workflows-tutorial>` tutorial.


---------------------------------
``spack.yaml`` and ``spack.lock``
---------------------------------

We've shown you how to interact with environments from the command line, but
they also have a file-based interface that can be used by developers and admins
to manage projects in a reproducible way.

In this section, we'll dive a little deeper to see how environments are
implemented, and how you could use this in your day-to-day development.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``spack.yaml``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Earlier, we changed an environment's configuration using ``spack config
edit``.  We were actually editing a special file called ``spack.yaml``.
Let's take a look.

We can get directly to the current environment's location using ``spack cd``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/filenames-1.out
   :language: console


You should notice two things here. First, the environment is just a directory
inside of ``var/spack/environments`` within the Spack installation. Second, it
contains two important files: ``spack.yaml`` and ``spack.lock``.

``spack.yaml`` is the configuration file for environments that we've
already seen, but it does not *have* to live inside Spack.  If you create
an environment using ``spack env create``, it is *managed* by
Spack in the ``var/spack/environments`` directory, and you can refer to
it by name.

You can actually put a ``spack.yaml`` file *anywhere*, and you can use it
to bundle an environment, or a list of dependencies to install, with your
project.  Let's make a simple project:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/anonymous-create-1.out
   :language: console


Here, we made a new directory called *code*, and we used the ``-d``
option to create an environment in it.

What really happened?

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/anonymous-create-2.out
   :language: console


Spack just created a ``spack.yaml`` file in the code directory, with an
empty list of root specs.  Now we have a Spack environment, *in a
directory*, that we can use to manage dependencies.  Suppose your project
depends on ``boost``, ``trilinos``, and ``openmpi``.  You can add these
to your spec list:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # This is a Spack Environment file.
   #
   # It describes a set of packages to be installed, along with
   # configuration settings.
   spack:
     # add package specs to the `specs` list
     specs:
     - boost
     - trilinos
     - openmpi

And now *anyone* who uses the *code* repository can use this format to
install the project's dependencies.  They need only clone the repository,
``cd`` into it, and type ``spack install``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/install-anonymous-1.out
   :language: console


Spack concretizes the specs in the ``spack.yaml`` file and installs them.

So, from ``~/code``, we can actually manipulate ``spack.yaml`` using
``spack add`` and ``spack remove`` (just like managed environments):

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/add-anonymous-1.out
   :language: console


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
``spack.lock``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Okay, we've covered managed environments, environments in directories, and
the last thing we'll cover is ``spack.lock``. You may remember that when
we ran ``spack install``, Spack concretized all the specs in the
``spack.yaml`` file and installed them.

Whenever we concretize Specs in an environment, all concrete specs in the
environment are written out to a ``spack.lock`` file *alongside*
``spack.yaml``.  The ``spack.lock`` file is not really human-readable
like the ``spack.yaml`` file.  It is a ``json`` format that contains all
the information that we need to *reproduce* the build of an
environment:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/lockfile-1.out
   :language: console


``spack.yaml`` and ``spack.lock`` correspond to two fundamental concepts
in Spack:

  * ``spack.yaml`` is the set of *abstract* specs and configuration that
    you want to install.
  * ``spack.lock`` is the set of all fully *concrete* specs generated from
    concretizing ``spack.yaml``

In this sense, you can think of environments as generalizations of specs, but
for sets of packages.

``spack.yaml`` and ``spack.lock`` both allow you to recreate an environment
that someone else built. You can pass either as an argument to ``spack env
create``:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/environments/create-from-file-1.out
   :language: console


Both of these create a new environment from the old one, but which one you
choose depends on your needs:

1. ``abstract``: copying the ``spack.yaml`` file allows someone else to build
   your *requirements*, potentially a different way.

2. ``concrete``: copying the ``spack.lock`` file allows someone else to rebuild
   your *installation* exactly as you built it.

The first use case can *re-concretize* the same specs on new platforms in order
to build, but it will preserve the abstract requirements. The second use case
(currently) requires you to be on the same type of machine, but it retains all
decisions made during concretization and is faithful to a prior install.
