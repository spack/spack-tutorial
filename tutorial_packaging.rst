=========================
Package Creation Tutorial
=========================

This tutorial walks you through the steps for creating and
debugging a simple Spack package. We will develop and debug
a package using an iterative approach in order to gain more
experience with additional Spack commands. For consistency,
we will create the package for ``mpileaks``, which is an MPI
debugging tool.

------------------------
What is a Spack Package?
------------------------

Spack packages are installation scripts, which are essentially
recipes for building the software.

They define properties and behavior of the build, such as:

* where to find and how to retrieve the software;
* its dependencies;
* options for building the software from source; and
* build commands.

Once we've specified a package's recipe, users of our recipe can
ask Spack to build the software with different features on any of
the supported systems.

-------
Caveats
-------

This tutorial assumes you have a working version of Spack installed.
Refer to the `Getting Started
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#getting-started>`_
guide for information on how to install Spack.

We'll be writing code so it is assumed you have at least a
**beginner's-level familiarity with Python**.

Being a tutorial, this document can help you get started with packaging,
but it is not intended to be complete. See Spack's `Packaging Guide
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#packaging-guide>`_
for more complete documentation on this topic.
The example code snippets used in this section can be found at
https://github.com/spack/spack-tutorial under ``tutorial/examples``.

---------------
Getting Started
---------------

Before we get started, you need to confirm you have three environment
variables set as follows:

* ``SPACK_ROOT``: consisting of the path to your Spack installation;
* ``PATH``: including ``$SPACK_ROOT/bin`` (so calls to the ``spack`` command
  work); and
* ``EDITOR``: containing the path of your preferred text editor (so Spack can
  run it when we modify the package).

The first two variables are automatically set by ``setup-env.sh`` so, if they
aren't, run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ . share/spack/setup-env.sh

or the equivalent for your shell (e.g., ``csh``, ``fish``).

In order to avoid modifying your Spack installation with the package we
are creating, add a **package repository** just for this tutorial by
entering the following command:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/repo-add.out
   :language: console

Doing this ensures changes we make here do not adversely affect other
parts of the tutorial. You can find out more about repositories at
`Package Repositories <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/repositories.html>`_.

-------------------------
Creating the Package File
-------------------------

Suppose you want to install software that depends on mpileaks but found
Spack did not already have a built-in package for it. This means you are
going to have to create one.

Spack's *create* command builds a new package from a template by taking
the location of the package's source code and using it to:

* fetch the code;
* create a package skeleton; and
* open the file up in your editor of choice.

.. note::

   An example of creating a package from software with more available
   versions can be found at `Creating and Editing Packages
   <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#creating-editing-packages>`_.

The ``mpileaks`` source code is available in a tarball in the
software's repository (https://github.com/LLNL/mpileaks). Spack
will look at the contents of the tarball and generate a package when we
run ``spack create`` with the URL:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/create.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

You should now be in your text editor of choice, with the ``package.py``
file open for editing. 

Your ``package.py`` file should reside in the ``mpileaks`` subdirectory of
your tutorial repository's ``packages`` directory, i.e.,
``$SPACK_ROOT/var/spack/repos/tutorial/packages/mpileaks/package.py``

Take a moment to look over the file.

As we can see from the skeleton contents, shown below, the Spack
template:

* provides instructions for how to contribute your package to
  the Spack repository;
* indicates the software is built with ``Autotools``;
* provides a docstring template;
* provides an example homepage URL;
* shows how to specify a list of package maintainers;
* specifies the version directive, with checksum, for the software;
* shows a dependency directive example; and
* provides a skeleton ``configure_args`` method.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/examples/0.package.py
   :caption: mpileaks/package.py (from tutorial/examples/0.package.py)
   :language: python
   :emphasize-lines: 26,27,29-30,33-35,39-40,43-44

.. note::

   The ``maintainers`` field is a comma-separated list of GitHub user
   names for those people who are willing to be notified when a change
   is made to the package. This information is useful for developers who
   maintain a Spack package for their own software and or rely on software
   maintained by other people.

We will fill in the provided placeholders as we:

* document some information about this package;
* add dependencies; and
* add the configuration arguments needed to build the package.

For the moment, though, let's see what Spack does with the skeleton.

Exit your editor and try to build the package with the ``spack install``
command:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/install-mpileaks-1.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,19

It clearly did not build. The error indicates ``configure`` is unable 
to find the installation location of a dependency.

So let's start to customize the package to our software.

----------------------------
Adding Package Documentation
----------------------------

First let's fill in the documentation.

Bring mpileaks' ``package.py`` file back into your ``$EDITOR`` with the
``spack edit`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ spack edit mpileaks

Let's make the following changes:

* remove the instructions between dashed lines at the top;
* replace the first ``FIXME`` comment with a description of ``mpileaks``
  in the docstring;
* replace the homepage property with the correct link; and
* uncomment the ``maintainers`` property and add your GitHub user name.

.. note::

   We will exclude the ``Copyright`` clause in the remainder of
   the package snippets here to reduce the length of the tutorial
   documentation; however, it **should be retained** for published
   packages.

Now make the changes and additions to your ``package.py`` file.

The resulting package should contain the following information:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/examples/1.package.py
   :caption: mpileaks/package.py (from tutorial/examples/1.package.py)
   :lines: 6-
   :language: python
   :emphasize-lines: 5-6,8,11

At this point we've only updated key documentation within the package.
It won't help us build the software but the information is now available
for review.

Let's enter the ``spack info`` command for the package:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/info-mpileaks.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1-2,5-6,8,10,16,25,28,31,34

Take a moment to look over the output. You should see the following
information derived from the package:

* it is an ``Autotools`` package;
* it has the description, homepage, and maintainer(s) we provided;
* it has the URL we gave the ``spack create`` command;
* the preferred version was derived from the code; and
* the default ``Autotools`` package installation phases are listed.

There are different types of dependencies shown with values of ``None``
because we must add them manually.

As we fill in more information about the package, the ``spack info``
command will become more informative.

.. note::

   More information on using ``Autotools`` packages is provided in
   `AutotoolsPackage 
   <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_systems/autotoolspackage.html#phases>`_.

   The full list of build systems known to Spack can be found at
   `Build Systems
   <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_systems.html>`_.

Now we're read to start filling in the build recipe.

-------------------
Adding Dependencies
-------------------

First we'll add the dependencies determined by reviewing documentation
in the software's repository (https://github.com/LLNL/mpileaks). The
``mpileaks`` software relies on three third-party libraries:

* ``mpi``,
* ``adept-utils``, and
* ``callpath``.

.. note::

   Luckily, all of these dependencies are built-in packages in Spack;
   otherwise, we would have to create packages for them as well.

Bring mpileaks' ``package.py`` file back up in your ``$EDITOR`` with
the ``spack edit`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ spack edit mpileaks

and add the dependencies by specifying them using the ``depends_on``
directive as shown below:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/examples/2.package.py
   :caption: mpileaks/package.py (from tutorial/examples/2.package.py)
   :lines: 6-
   :language: python
   :emphasize-lines: 15-17

Adding dependencies tells Spack that it must ensure these packages are
installed *before* it can build our package.

.. note::

  The ``mpi`` dependency is different from the other two in that it is
  a *virtual dependency*. That means Spack must satisfy the dependency
  with a package that *provides* the ``mpi`` interface, such as ``openmpi``
  or ``mvapich2``.

  We call such packages **providers**. See the `Packaging Guide
  <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#packaging-guide>`_
  for more information on virtual dependencies.

We now get a lot further when we try to build the software again with
``spack install``.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/install-mpileaks-2.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,215

.. note::

   This command may take a while to run and may produce more output if
   you don't already have an MPI installed or configured in Spack.

We see that Spack has now identified and built all of our dependencies.
It found that the:

* ``openmpi`` package will satisfy our ``mpi`` dependency;
* ``callpath`` is a concrete dependency; and
* ``adept-utils`` is a concrete dependency.

**But** we are still not able to build the package.

------------------------
Debugging Package Builds
------------------------

Our ``mpileaks`` package is still not building due to the ``adept-utils``
package's ``configure`` error. Experienced ``Autotools`` developers will
likely already see the problem and its solution.

But let's take this opportunity to use Spack features to investigate
the problem. Our options for proceeding are:

* review the build log; and
* build the package manually.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reviewing the Build Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The build log might yield some clues so let's look at the contents of
the ``spack-build-out.txt`` file at the path recommended above by our
failed installation:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/build-output.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,30

In this case the error conveniently appears on the last line of the
log *and* the output from `spack install`.

Here we also see a number of checks performed by the ``configure`` command.
Most importantly, the last line is very clear: the installation path of the
``adept-utils`` dependency cannot be found.

.. note::

   Spack automatically adds standard include and library directories
   to the compiler's search path *but* it is not uncommon for this
   information to not get picked up. Some software, like ``mpileaks``,
   requires the paths to be explicitly provided on the command line.

So let's investigate further from the staged build directory.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Building Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First let's try to build the package manually to see if we can
figure out how to solve the problem.

Let's move to the build directory using the ``spack cd`` command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack cd mpileaks

You should now be in the appropriate stage directory since this
command moves us into the working directory of the last attempted
build.

Now let's ensure the environment is properly set up using the
``spack build-env`` command:

.. code-block:: console

  $ spack build-env mpileaks bash

This command spawned a new shell containing the same environment
that Spack used to build the ``mpileaks`` package. (Feel free to
substitute your favorite shell for ``bash``.)

From here we can manually re-run the build using the ``configure``
command:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/build-env-configure.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,27

And we get the same results as before. Unfortunately, the output
does not provide any additional information that can help us with
the build.

Given this is a simple package built with ``configure`` and we know
that installation directories need to be specified, we can use its
help to see what command line options are available for the software.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/configure-help.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,80-81

Note that you can specify the paths for the two concrete dependencies
with the following options:

* ``--with-adept-utils=PATH``
* ``--with-callpath=PATH``

So let's leave the spawned shell and return to the Spack repository
directory:

.. code-block:: console

  $ exit
  $ cd $SPACK_ROOT

Now that we know what arguments to provide, we can update the recipe.

------------------------------
Specifying Configure Arguments
------------------------------

We now know which options we need to pass to ``configure``, but how do we
know where to find the installation paths for the package's dependencies
from within the ``package.py`` file?

Fortunately, we can query the package's concrete ``Spec`` instance.
The ``self.spec`` property holds the package's directed acyclic graph
(DAG) of its dependencies. Each dependency's ``Spec``, accessed by name,
has a ``prefix`` property containing its installation path.

So let's add the configuration arguments for specifying the paths to
the two concrete dependencies in the ``configure_args`` method of our
package.

Bring mpileaks' ``package.py`` file back up in your ``$EDITOR`` with
the ``spack edit`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ spack edit mpileaks

and add the ``--with-adept-utils`` and ``--with-callpath`` arguments
in the ``configure_args`` method as follows:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/examples/3.package.py
   :caption: mpileaks/package.py (from tutorial/examples/3.package.py)
   :lines: 6-
   :language: python
   :emphasize-lines: 20-23

Since this is an ``AutotoolsPackage``, the arguments returned from the
method will automatically get passed to ``configure`` during the build.

Now let's try the build again:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/install-mpileaks-3.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1

Success!

All we needed to do was add the path arguments for the two concrete
packages for configure to perform a simple, no frills build.

But is that all we can do to help other users build our software?

---------------
Adding Variants
---------------

What if we want to expose the software's optional features in the package?
We can do this by adding build-time options using package *variants*.

Recall from configure's help output for ``mpileaks`` that the software has
several optional features and packages that we could support in Spack.
Two stand out for tutorial purposes because they both take integers,
as opposed to simply allowing them to be enabled or disabled.

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/configure-build-options.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 18-23

According to the software's documentation (https://github.com/LLNL/mpileaks),
the integer values for the ``--with-stack-start*`` options represent the
numbers of calls to shave off of the top of the stack traces for each
language, effectively reducing the noise of internal mpileaks library function
calls in generated traces.

For simplicity, we'll use one variant to supply the value for both arguments.

Supporting this optional feature will require two changes to the package:

* add a ``variant`` directive; and
* change the configure options to use the value.

Let's add the variant to expect an ``int`` value with a default of
``0``. Defaulting to ``0`` effectively disables the option. Also change
``configure_args`` to retrieve the value and add the corresponding
configure arguments when a non-zero value is provided by the user.

Bring mpileaks' ``package.py`` file back up in your ``$EDITOR`` with
the ``spack edit`` command:

.. code-block:: console

   $ spack edit mpileaks

and add the ``variant`` directive and associated arguments as follows:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial/examples/4.package.py
   :caption: mpileaks/package.py (from tutorial/examples/4.package.py)
   :lines: 6-
   :language: python
   :emphasize-lines: 15-16,28-33

Notice the ``variant`` directive is translated into a ``variants`` dictionary
in ``self.spec``. Also note that the value provided by the user is accessed
by the entry's ``value`` property.

Now run the installation again with the ``--verbose`` install option -- to
get more output during the build -- and the new ``stackstart`` package option:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/install-mpileaks-4.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,41

Notice the addition of the two stack start arguments in the configure
command that appears at the end of the highlighted line after mpileaks'
``Executing phase: 'configure'``.

At this point we've covered how to create a package; update its
documentation; add dependencies; and add variants to support
builds with optional features.

What if you need to customize the build to reflect feature changes?

------------------------
Querying the Spec Object
------------------------

As packages evolve and are ported to different systems, the builds
often need to be changed. This is where the package's ``Spec`` comes
in.

So far we've looked at getting the paths for dependencies and values of
variants from the ``Spec`` but there is more. The package's ``self.spec``,
property allows you to query information about the package build, such as:

* how a package's dependencies were built;
* what compiler was being used;
* what version of a package is being installed; and
* what variants were specified (implicitly or explicitly).

Full documentation can be found in the `Packaging Guide
<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#packaging-guide>`_,
but examples of common queries are provided below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Querying Spec Versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can customize the build based on the version of the package, compiler,
and dependencies. Examples of each are:

* Am I building ``mpileaks`` version ``1.1`` or greater?

.. code-block:: python

   if self.spec.satisfies('@1.1:'):
       # Do things needed for 1.1+

* Am I building with a ``gcc`` version less than ``5.0.0``:

.. code-block:: python

   if self.spec.satisfies('%gcc@:5.0.0'):
       # Add arguments specific to gcc's earlier than 5.0.0

* Is my ``dyninst`` dependency greater than version ``8.0``?

.. code-block:: python

   if self.spec['dyninst'].satisfies('@8.0:'):
       # Use newest dyninst options

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Querying Spec Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the build has to be customized to the concrete version of an abstract
``Spec`` you can use its ``name`` property. For example:

* Is ``openmpi`` the MPI I'm building with?

.. code-block:: python

   if self.spec['mpi'].name == 'openmpi':
       # Do openmpi things

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Querying Variants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjusting build options based on enabled variants can be done by querying
the ``Spec`` itself, such as:

* Am I building with the ``debug`` variant:

.. code-block:: python

   if '+debug' in self.spec:
       # Add -g option to configure flags


These are just a few examples of ``Spec`` queries. Spack has thousands of
built-in packages that can serve as examples to guide the development
of your package. You can find these packages in
``$SPACK_ROOT/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages``.

Good Luck!

-----------
Cleaning Up
-----------

Before leaving this tutorial, let's ensure what we have done does not
interfere with your Spack instance or future sections of the tutorial.
Undo the work we've done here by entering the following commands:

.. literalinclude:: outputs/packaging/cleanup.out
   :language: console
   :emphasize-lines: 1,4,6
